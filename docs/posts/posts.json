You can write about all of them, or select one\nquestion, depending on where you’re now.\nAnswer and Explanation: My second blog post concerns\nthe first of the two research ideas I had decided The characteristics\ninclude (1) its ‘content’ and/or (2) how it can be scraped. I Summon up\nyour knowledge of some useful packages we’ve reviewed and/or NLP tools\nin relation to your research project. F Sorting out adjectives? F\nExtracting major verbs or named entities? … I Specify a research paper\nor two regarding your research domain/topic. Focus on their ‘data,’\nanalytic strategy, and findings. If they use text-as-data methods, use\nthem as a friendly example. If they have nothing to do with text-as-data\nmethods, imagine what you can do differently.

    "contents": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground and Research\nQuestion:\nWikipedia is self-described as a “free content, multilingual online\nencyclopedia written and maintained by a community of volunteers through\na model of open collaboration,” information on the website i shared and\nmaintained “using a wiki-based editing system. [and] Individual\ncontributors,” being the 5th most visited website in the world it is\nalso the largest and most-read reference work in history.” (“https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia”) Because of\nWikipedia’s position, as an arbiter of information and reference for a\nnumber of subjects, it is essential to understand the nature of the\nrequired citations and how they inform the websites portrayal of history\nand information. (Chase 2021)\nConflict is a defining feature of history, the results of war and the\ngroups involved are essential to understanding dynamics of power\nglobally. A war can represent the transfer of material, territorial, and\nstrategic power between groups. As a result the networks of wars between\nnations can give some notion of power centrality among warring\nnations.\nSince wikipedia has become a widely accepted (if often critiqued)\nsource of information, its citations and the information resulting from\nthem can give us a sense of how where the center of global conflict, and\nthus the most central nations, according to popular and accessible\nacademic literature.\nhttps://www.visualcapitalist.com/the-50-most-visited-websites-in-the-world/\nChase, Matt. “Wikipedia is 20, and its reputation has never been\nhigher”. The Economist. January 9, 2021. Retrieved February 25,\n2021.\n\n\n\nPart 1:\nDescribe the Dataset You Are\nUsing:\nThe Dataset Being Used: The dataset that I am using\nis wikipedia list of wars throughout history, this article is the “List\nof wars: 1000–1499” which acts as a subset of the “2nd-millennium\nconflicts” I chose this dataset as an exemplar of popular history’s\ndepiction of the centralization of worldwide conflict. Wikipedia, being\nan accessible source generally created from relevant citations makes it\na good case study to see where historical writers and academics center\ntheir world are relevant conflicts.\nIdentify initial network\nformat:\nAnswer: The initial network format is as an edge\nlist, the first, in column contains the winners of each\nwar while the second, out column contains the losers of\neach. These sets of belligerents are directed\nNetwork\nStructure: Wars Startings in the 1000s\n\n Network attributes:\n  vertices = 117 \n  directed = TRUE \n  hyper = FALSE \n  loops = FALSE \n  multiple = TRUE \n  bipartite = FALSE \n  total edges= 153 \n    missing edges= 0 \n    non-missing edges= 153 \n\n Vertex attribute names: \n    vertex.names \n\nNo edge attributes\n\nNetwork\nStructure: Wars Startings in the 1100s\n\n Network attributes:\n  vertices = 97 \n  directed = TRUE \n  hyper = FALSE \n  loops = FALSE \n  multiple = TRUE \n  bipartite = FALSE \n  total edges= 238 \n    missing edges= 0 \n    non-missing edges= 238 \n\n Vertex attribute names: \n    vertex.names \n\nNo edge attributes\n\nNetwork\nStructure: Wars Startings in the 1200s\n\n Network attributes:\n  vertices = 161 \n  directed = TRUE \n  hyper = FALSE \n  loops = FALSE \n  multiple = TRUE \n  bipartite = FALSE \n  total edges= 313 \n    missing edges= 0 \n    non-missing edges= 313 \n\n Vertex attribute names: \n    vertex.names \n\nNo edge attributes\n\nIdentify Nodes: Describe and identify the nodes\n(including how many nodes are in the dataset)\nAnswer: Nodes or vertices in these datasets\nrepresent belligerents in wars throughout history, the involved parties\nin each conflict can be a nation, province, individual, or group so long\nas they are listed as involved in the conflict. In the 1000s there are\n117, in the 1100s there are 78 and in the 1200s there are 161.\nWhat Constitutes a Tie: What constitutes a tie or\nedge (including how many ties, whether ties are directed/undirected and\nweighted/binary, and how to interpret the value of the tie if any)\nAnswer: A tie or edge in this dataset represents a\nwar, this war can be between two nations or groups within a nation.\nThese edges can represent a war that involved many more nations but are\nalways tied to each and every party involved on both sides. These edges\nare directed and the direction indicates which side “won” the conflict\n(if an edge has an arrow pointing to another the node that originated\nthat arrow won the war against them. There are 153 edges in the 1000s,\n225 edges in 1100s and 313 edges in the 1200s.\nEdge Attributes and Subset: Whether or not there are\nedge attributes that might be used to subset data or stack multiple\nnetworks (e.g., tie type, year, etc).\nAnswer: There are a number of attributes that could\nbe used to subset the data, year that the conflict began or the length\nof time it lasted are available.

Otherwise, you may want to orient your analysis as follows in\norder to identify a compelling question or noteworthy pattern in the\ndata that can be interpreted.\nAnswer: Since I am interested in the relative power\nof nations by their relative position ad centrality in the worldwide\nconflict, network brokerage can be used to illustrate significant\npositions in global conflict. Below I wanted to look at 4 kinds of\nbrokerage, these are broker.gate or gatekeeper, coordinator, liason, and\nitinerant. I am interested to see if these specific coordination types\nare primarily done by specific nations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Brokerage\nExplanation: Looking at total brokerage in this\ndataset gives a sense of which factions were responsible for highest\nconnection of unconnected actors through conflict. Given the crusades\nigniting conflict between Europe and the middle east it is sensible that\nthe Byzantine Empire in the center of both connects the most unconnected\nactors through conflict closely followed by the Sultanate of Rum, a\nmajor Muslim faction that fought against the crusades and third being\nthe Holy Roman Empire who participated in many conflicts including the\ncrusades. These are followed by England who centered the wars in the\nBritish isles and the Kingdom of Sicily who were also in a position of\nconflict.\n\nname\nbroker.tot\nByzantine Empire\n25.272873\nSultanate of Rum\n10.436488\nHoly Roman Empire\n10.024366\nEngland\n7.551635\nKingdom of Sicily\n5.491026\n\nCoordinator Brokerage\nExplanation: In this case no particular country is\nvery high above any other in terms of their coordinator brokerage,\nmeaning that within groups no particular nations appear to be brokering\nmore within the groups.\n\nname\nbroker.coord\nCounty of Aversa\n-0.0158536\nKingdom of Georgia\n-0.0158536\nGreat Seljuq Empire\n-0.0158536\nPapal States\n-0.0158536\nChola Empire\n-0.0158536\n\nItinerant Brokerage\nExplanation: Itinerant brokerage represents when a\nnon-group actor connects 2 actors in a group it is no in to each other,\nin this case England has the highest score. Looking at the network graph\nthey do appear to connect 2 actors in a group together.\n\nname\nbroker.itin\nEngland\n6.6906430\nHoly Roman Empire\n4.8919293\nKingdom of Sicily\n3.9930250\nByzantine Empire\n3.9930250\nPrincipality of Kiev\n0.4413428\n\nRepresentative Brokerage\nExplanation: Representative brokerage indicates that\nthe broker, or nation in question loses a war to another in their group,\nbut wins another against a faction outside of their group. This can be\nthough of as their directed connections to them. In this case the Seljuk\nEmpire and Kingdom of Aragon have instances in which they lose to\nfactions within their group before beating those outside of it.\n\nname\nbroker.rep\nSeljuk Empire\n6.3140099\nKingdom of Aragon\n1.1415607\nCounty of Sicily\n-0.0800286\nEngland\n-0.0800286\nCounty of Aversa\n-0.1126843\n\nGatekeeper Brokerage\nExplanation: The Papal states being ranked highest\nin gatekeeper brokerage is an interesting observation as no other nation\nin the dataset appears to be close to their level as most are negative\nin this category. In this cae being a gatekeeper means that they are in\nat conflict in a group with another while the nation in a different\ngroup of conflicts is only at war with them from the group. This is an\ninteresting observation given the Papal states role as a coordinator of\nthe war, but not a participant in the conflcit as directly as other\nbelligerents. (This being the crusade given the period)\n\nname\nbroker.gate\nPapal States\n11.6872209\nCounty of Sicily\n-0.0800286\nEngland\n-0.0800286\nCounty of Aversa\n-0.1126843\nKingdom of Georgia\n-0.1126843\n\nLiaison Brokerage\nExplanation: A liaison broker, in this case, is a\nfaction that loses a war to a group they do not belong to and wins a war\nagainst a different group than the first that they also do not belong\nto. The Byzantine Empire, Sultanate of Rum, and Holy Roman Empire are\nhighest in this category likely owing to their frequent states of\nconflict beyond the crusades against a variety of groups.\n\nname\nbroker.lia\nByzantine Empire\n31.767840\nSultanate of Rum\n14.454659\nHoly Roman Empire\n10.545231\nEngland\n6.202342\nKingdom of Sicily\n4.960334\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(information regarding the meaning of each type of brokerage was\nacquired from https://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/publication/WC197)\n\n\n\n",

These edges can represent a war that involved many more nations but are always tied to each and every party involved on both sides. These edges are directed and the direction indicates which side “won” the conflict.\nQuestion: Whether or not there are edge attributes that might be used to subset data or stack multiple networks (e.g., tie type, year, etc).\nAnswer: There are a number of attributes that could be used to subset the data, years that the conflict began or the length of time it lasted are available.

Here we see the top 5 highest observations in each dataset, in the 1000s the Byzantine Empire has the highest war, which is logical historically as they represented a bridge between major fighting factions in the Crusades between the Muslim Middle East and European west. The Kingdom of Jerusalem in the 1100s would also be connected, through its wars to other important powers being contested territory between Muslim empires like the Ayyubid Dynasty and crusading states like the Holy Roman Empire.\n\n\narrange(wars_in_1000s.nodes.stat, desc(eigen.rc\n))%>%\n  slice(1:5) %>% kable()\n\n\nname\ntotdegree\nindegree\noutdegree\neigen\nrc\neigen.rc\ndc\neigen.dc\nHoly Roman Empire\n15\n2\n13\n0.295686\n1.0000000\n0.2956860\n0.0000000\n0.0000000\nByzantine Empire\n18\n5\n13\n0.478430\n0.3571429\n0.1708679\n0.6428571\n0.3075621\nSultanate of Rum\n11\n7\n4\n0.295686\n0.1186441\n0.0350814\n0.8813559\n0.2606046\nKingdom of Georgia\n5\n1\n4\n0.295686\n0.0769231\n0.0227451\n0.9230769\n0.2729409\nKingdom of France\n10\n3\n7\n0.182744\n0.1034483\n0.0189046\n0.8965517\n0.1638394\n\narrange(wars_in_1100s.nodes.stat, desc(eigen.rc\n))%>%\n  slice(1:5) %>% kable()\n\n\nname\ntotdegree\nindegree\noutdegree\neigen\nrc\neigen.rc\ndc\neigen.dc\nAyyubid Dynasty\n18\n10\n8\n0.5188525\n0.3200000\n0.1660328\n0.6800000\n0.3528197\nKingdom of Jerusalem\n23\n11\n12\n0.5378974\n0.2980769\n0.1603348\n0.7019231\n0.3775626\nFatimid Caliphate\n17\n7\n10\n0.2202864\n0.2884615\n0.0635442\n0.7115385\n0.1567423\nZengid Dynasty\n16\n6\n10\n0.2202864\n0.1714286\n0.0377634\n0.8285714\n0.1825230\nRepublic of Venice\n6\n1\n5\n0.0797655\n0.3333333\n0.0265885\n0.6666667\n0.0531770\n\narrange(wars_in_1200s.nodes.stat, desc(eigen.rc\n))%>%\n  slice(1:5) %>% kable()\n\n\nname\ntotdegree\nindegree\noutdegree\neigen\nrc\neigen.rc\ndc\neigen.dc\nKnights Templar\n22\n3\n19\n0.4663665\n0.1428571\n0.0666238\n0.8571429\n0.3997427\nAyyubid Dynasty\n23\n9\n14\n0.4263748\n0.1046512\n0.0446206\n0.8953488\n0.3817542\nRepublic of Genoa\n18\n5\n13\n0.2880895\n0.1428571\n0.0411556\n0.8571429\n0.2469339\nKingdom of Cyprus\n11\n4\n7\n0.2025283\n0.1428571\n0.0289326\n0.8571429\n0.1735957\nMongol Empire\n41\n7\n34\n0.2228895\n0.1206897\n0.0269005\n0.8793103\n0.1959891\n\nAnswer: Reflected centrality represents the centrality one nation receives from another another that is attributable to the first nations contribution to the other nations score. Looking at reflected centrality through wars we see relatively similar trends. In the 1000s the Holy Roman Empire and Byzantine Empire play a distinct role in the crusades so in this case we see how central a nation is in conflict dependent on how much centrality they contribute to a nation they have a conflict with. Being focal points in the center of Europe in the case of the HRE and the focal point of Christian, Muslim conflict in the case of the Byzantine empire. For both fighting minor nations gives the two a great deal of centrality to other, potentially less central groups that they fight. The Ayyubids and Kingdom of Jerusalem that each occupy a central position in conflict. Into the 1200s the Knights Templar and Ayyubids occupy this position.\n\n\narrange(wars_in_1000s.nodes.stat, desc(eigen.dc\n\n))%>%\n  slice(1:5) %>% kable()\n\n\nname\ntotdegree\nindegree\noutdegree\neigen\nrc\neigen.rc\ndc\neigen.dc\nByzantine Empire\n18\n5\n13\n0.478430\n0.3571429\n0.1708679\n0.6428571\n0.3075621\nMirdasid Emirate of Aleppo\n1\n0\n1\n0.295686\n0.0000000\n0.0000000\n1.0000000\n0.2956860\nDuklja\n1\n0\n1\n0.295686\n0.0000000\n0.0000000\n1.0000000\n0.2956860\nGreat Seljuq Empire\n4\n0\n4\n0.295686\n0.0000000\n0.0000000\n1.0000000\n0.2956860\nKingdom of Georgia\n5\n1\n4\n0.295686\n0.0769231\n0.0227451\n0.9230769\n0.2729409\n\narrange(wars_in_1100s.nodes.stat, desc(eigen.dc\n\n))%>%\n  slice(1:5) %>% kable()\n\n\nname\ntotdegree\nindegree\noutdegree\neigen\nrc\neigen.rc\ndc\neigen.dc\nKingdom of Jerusalem\n23\n11\n12\n0.5378974\n0.2980769\n0.1603348\n0.7019231\n0.3775626\nAyyubid Dynasty\n18\n10\n8\n0.5188525\n0.3200000\n0.1660328\n0.6800000\n0.3528197\nSultanate of Rum\n23\n0\n23\n0.2893116\n0.0000000\n0.0000000\n1.0000000\n0.2893116\nAlmoravid Dynasty\n10\n0\n10\n0.2202864\n0.0000000\n0.0000000\n1.0000000\n0.2202864\nAbbasid Caliphate\n10\n0\n10\n0.2202864\n0.0000000\n0.0000000\n1.0000000\n0.2202864\n\narrange(wars_in_1200s.nodes.stat, desc(eigen.dc\n\n))%>%\n  slice(1:5) %>% kable()\n\n\nname\ntotdegree\nindegree\noutdegree\neigen\nrc\neigen.rc\ndc\neigen.dc\nKnights Templar\n22\n3\n19\n0.4663665\n0.1428571\n0.0666238\n0.8571429\n0.3997427\nAyyubid Dynasty\n23\n9\n14\n0.4263748\n0.1046512\n0.0446206\n0.8953488\n0.3817542\nBahris\n7\n0\n7\n0.2911519\n0.0000000\n0.0000000\n1.0000000\n0.2911519\nRepublic of Genoa\n18\n5\n13\n0.2880895\n0.1428571\n0.0411556\n0.8571429\n0.2469339\nAnti-Imperial faction\n7\n0\n7\n0.2025283\n0.0000000\n0.0000000\n1.0000000\n0.2025283\n\nAnswer: Finally Derived Centrality measures the centrality a nation receives from fighting another nation that is not a reflection of the first nation’s contribution of centrality to the others. Here the Byzantine Empire remains one of the largest, potentially suggesting their status as a cosmopolitan being high in both derived and reflected centrality. However, nations like the Mirdasid Emirate of Aleppo have little to no reflected centrality by high derived centrality suggesting that they are are a pure bridge.\n\n\nwars_in_1000s.nodes<-data.frame(name=V(wars_in_1000s.ig)$name,\n    totdegree=igraph::degree(wars_in_1000s.ig, loops=FALSE),\n    indegree=igraph::degree(wars_in_1000s.ig, mode=\"in\", loops=FALSE),\n    outdegree=igraph::degree(wars_in_1000s.ig, mode=\"out\", loops=FALSE))\n\nwars_in_1100s.nodes<-data.frame(name=V(wars_in_1100s.ig)$name,\n    totdegree=igraph::degree(wars_in_1100s.ig, loops=FALSE),\n    indegree=igraph::degree(wars_in_1100s.ig, mode=\"in\", loops=FALSE),\n    outdegree=igraph::degree(wars_in_1100s.ig, mode=\"out\", loops=FALSE))\n\nwars_in_1200s.nodes<-data.frame(name=V(wars_in_1200s.ig)$name,\n    totdegree=igraph::degree(wars_in_1200s.ig, loops=FALSE),\n    indegree=igraph::degree(wars_in_1200s.ig, mode=\"in\", loops=FALSE),\n    outdegree=igraph::degree(wars_in_1200s.ig, mode=\"out\", loops=FALSE))\n\neigen_cent_wars_in_1000s<-centr_eigen(wars_in_1000s.ig,directed=T)\n\neigen_cent_wars_in_1100s<-centr_eigen(wars_in_1100s.ig,directed=T)\n\neigen_cent_wars_in_1200s<-centr_eigen(wars_in_1200s.ig,directed=T)\n\n\n\nSome Attempts at Visualization\nGraph 1:\nExplanation: Below I have graphed the network for the 1000s dataset using base plot and an edgelist\n\n\nplot(wars_in_1000s_edgelist_network_edgelist, vertex.size=2,  edge.arrow.size=.2, vertex.color=\"gold\", vertex.size=20, vertex.frame.color=\"gray\", vertex.label.color=\"black\", vertex.label.cex=0.25, vertex.label.dist=2, edge.curved=0.2)\n\n\n\n\nGraph 2:\nExplanation: Next I used the igraph network object and graphed it using the automatic, proportional clustering.\n\n\n\nGraph 3:\nExplanation: Finally I used the ggplot network and graphed it using a generic network object.

Each vertex or node is a family in florence. Each edge, or tie represents a marriage between the two.\nAs a result the ties are not weighted, so they are binary. However, though the dataset labels the ties are directed, they are actually all mutual so in essence, the dataset does not measure marriaage “into” a family but simply uses a mutual directed tie for every set of families with a marriage between them.\n\n\nsna::dyad.census(statted_florentine)\n\n\n     Mut Asym Null\n[1,]  20    0  100\n\nAs can be seen from the code above the dyads within the dataset are either mutual or null, meaning that between any two nodes there are no asymmetric dyads despite the fact that the network is labeled as being directed.\n\n\nsna::triad.census(statted_florentine)\n\n\n     003 012 102 021D 021U 021C 111D 111U 030T 030C 201 120D 120U\n[1,] 324   0 195    0    0    0    0    0    0    0  38    0    0\n     120C 210 300\n[1,]    0   0   3\n\nAs can be seen from the triad census above the types of triads in the dataset are 324 of the 003-type, 102 of the 102-type, 38 of the 201-type and 3 of the 300-type. The 324 of 003-type and 195 of the 102-type indicate that 519 of the 560 triads are vacuously transitive, the remaining 38 of the 201-type are intransitive and only the 3 300-types are transitive\nTransitivity\nAs can be seen in the code below indicates the the transitivity of the network as a whole is 0.1914894, which follows from the results above. This would indicate a relatively low rate of transitivity and thus low inter-connectedness of the nodes and potientally lower density overall.\n\n\ngtrans(statted_florentine)\n\n\n[1] 0.1914894\n\nIsolates\nThough the code below indicates that there are 12 isolates in the network, the data from our plot suggests that this is likely untrue and due to the discrepancy between the un-directed true nature of the network and its label as directed as a network object.\n\n\nisolates(statted_florentine)\n\n\n[1] 12\n\nDensity\nAs indicated by the code chunk below network density here is 0.1666667 indicating that only 16.67% of possible ties in the network are made.\n\n\nnetwork.density(statted_florentine)\n\n\n[1] 0.1666667\n\nDegree and Interesting Results\nEach of the 16 node’s degrees are acquired from the code bellow in integer form, from the digits alone it is difficult to distinguish any sort of overall pattern in the data.\n\n\nsna::degree(statted_florentine)\n\n\n [1]  2  6  4  6  6  2  8  2 12  2  6  0  6  4  8  6\n\nBelow I create a data frame with the overall degree of each family.\n\n\nflorentine.nodes<-data.frame(name=statted_florentine%v%\"vertex.names\",\n                             degree=sna::degree(statted_florentine))\nflorentine.nodes\n\n\n           name degree\n1    Acciaiuoli      2\n2       Albizzi      6\n3     Barbadori      4\n4      Bischeri      6\n5    Castellani      6\n6        Ginori      2\n7      Guadagni      8\n8  Lamberteschi      2\n9        Medici     12\n10        Pazzi      2\n11      Peruzzi      6\n12        Pucci      0\n13      Ridolfi      6\n14     Salviati      4\n15      Strozzi      8\n16   Tornabuoni      6\n\nBelow I then calculate each individual nodes indegree and out-degree.\nNotewory Results\nUpon running the above code I realized that despite the network being labeled “directed” all of its ties were actually mutual and thus the in-degree and out-degree would be identical since marriage is considered mutual. Though this follows from the fact that are generally considered mutual it is interesting to observe that marriages are not considered “into” another family but are represented as a mutual, but directed ties between nodes in every case.\n\n\nsna::degree(statted_florentine, cmode=\"indegree\")\n\n\n [1] 1 3 2 3 3 1 4 1 6 1 3 0 3 2 4 3\n\nsna::degree(statted_florentine, cmode=\"outdegree\")\n\n\n [1] 1 3 2 3 3 1 4 1 6 1 3 0 3 2 4 3\n\nAs can be seen from the code above each node has identical in-degrees and out-degrees\n\n\nflorentine.nodes <- data.frame(name=statted_florentine%v%\"vertex.names\",\n    totdegree=sna::degree(statted_florentine),\n    indegree=sna::degree(statted_florentine, cmode=\"indegree\"),\n    outdegree=sna::degree(statted_florentine, cmode=\"outdegree\"))\n\nflorentine.nodes\n\n\n           name totdegree indegree outdegree\n1    Acciaiuoli         2        1         1\n2       Albizzi         6        3         3\n3     Barbadori         4        2         2\n4      Bischeri         6        3         3\n5    Castellani         6        3         3\n6        Ginori         2        1         1\n7      Guadagni         8        4         4\n8  Lamberteschi         2        1         1\n9        Medici        12        6         6\n10        Pazzi         2        1         1\n11      Peruzzi         6        3         3\n12        Pucci         0        0         0\n13      Ridolfi         6        3         3\n14     Salviati         4        2         2\n15      Strozzi         8        4         4\n16   Tornabuoni         6        3         3\n\nThe notion is confirmed by the degree summaries in the code below and the table above.

Specifically it would be useful to look at dynamics of marriages “into” other families as this would have been important at the time. Though marriage is considered symmetric in this dataset it was often used in asymmetric ways during the medieval and renaissance times as a means of diplomacy and establishing goodwill between nobility and as a result the ties between the families are not necessarily symmetric in all cases. It would be interesting to see married into what families in terms of sex and birth status hierarchy i.e. first, second, third born, etc.\n\n\nflo_sorted_by_total_degree<-florentine.nodes[order(-florentine.nodes$totdegree),]\n\nflo_sorted_by_total_degree\n\n\n           name totdegree indegree outdegree\n9        Medici        12        6         6\n7      Guadagni         8        4         4\n15      Strozzi         8        4         4\n2       Albizzi         6        3         3\n4      Bischeri         6        3         3\n5    Castellani         6        3         3\n11      Peruzzi         6        3         3\n13      Ridolfi         6        3         3\n16   Tornabuoni         6        3         3\n3     Barbadori         4        2         2\n14     Salviati         4        2         2\n1    Acciaiuoli         2        1         1\n6        Ginori         2        1         1\n8  Lamberteschi         2        1         1\n10        Pazzi         2        1         1\n12        Pucci         0        0         0\n\nThe results above indicate that the medici family are the most “central” node in the network having the most marriages and thus the most in-degrees and out-degrees. The mean of these two degrees is 2.5 in the dataset thus they have more than double the average marriages, however 4 other families have just 2, while the pucci’s have no ties.\nThis also poses the question as to whether or not there are more families that could be included and what the criteria was for allowance in the florentine family data. In this case 4-6 marriages is the most common with 6 nodes having 4-6 marriages.\nThe least central are the Pucci family who are included in the dataset but have no edges or connections to others families by marriage. The Acciaiuoli, Ginori, Lamberteschi, and Pazzi all have 2 total ties, one in and one out representing a single marriage.\n\n\ncentralization(statted_florentine, degree, cmode=\"indegree\")\n\n\n[1] 0.2488889\n\nThe measure of centralization above represents how concentrated edges between nodes are concentrated among actors. He centralization is slightly less than 25% which would indicate that concentration is relatively low this follows from the low transitivity of the network as a whole, there very few actual connections as compared to the possible connections. As a result of these findings it appears as if the network is not extremely centralized with most families having 2-3 marriages with the largest only being 6. The network also has a low level of transitivity as most nodes are not connected to one another.\nHowever it is important to note that we do not know aspects certain aspects of the families that are relevant to understanding the extent of the network’s true connectivity, this could be heirs with ties to both families marriages and the number of marriages between families that happened out of the possible number afforded to each family by their number of heirs. Having family tree measurements would allow for more meaningful analysis that could make the network truly directed by seeing who married into what family and what they represented to their families in terms of succession including their effects in creating prior generations that continued these connections.\n\n\n\n",

This dataset represents marriages between influential families in Florence. Each node represents a family with arrows indicating which family married into which other family.\nNetwork Size:\nNetwork size for the Florentine Family network dataset is described briefly by the code below:\n\n\nset.seed(2)\n# I access the florentine families dataset through the package \"network\"\n\ndata(flo, package=\"network\")\n\n# In order to make the dataset usable I make it into a matrix using as.matrix()\n\nmatrix_florentine <- as.matrix(flo) \n\n# Next I used the graph.adjacency command to make the florentine dataset into\n# An Adjacency Matrix \n\nflorentine<- graph.adjacency(flo, mode=\"directed\", weighted=NULL)\n\nplot(florentine, vertex.color=\"skyblue1\", vertex.label.color=\"navy\", \n     vertex.label.dist=1, vertex.size=7,  edge.arrow.size=0.5, margin=0000)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvcount(florentine)\n\n\n[1] 16\n\necount(florentine)\n\n\n[1] 40\n\n\n\nstatted_florentine<-as.network(matrix_florentine)\nprint(statted_florentine)\n\n\n Network attributes:\n  vertices = 16 \n  directed = TRUE \n  hyper = FALSE \n  loops = FALSE \n  multiple = FALSE \n  bipartite = FALSE \n  total edges= 40 \n    missing edges= 0 \n    non-missing edges= 40 \n\n Vertex attribute names: \n    vertex.names \n\nNo edge attributes\n\nThe number of vertices in the dataset is 16, in this case these nodes each represent a florentine family. Te number of edges is 40. In this instance ties or edges, represent marriages between these influential families. The is the same in both the statnet and igraph outputs.\nNetwork Features\nNext the features of the dataset are described using the 3 commands in the code chunk below.\n\n\nis_bipartite(florentine)\n\n\n[1] FALSE\n\nis_directed(florentine)\n\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nis_weighted(florentine)\n\n\n[1] FALSE\n\nThese results suggests that the florentine family dataset is not bipartite, which would indicate that they do not fall into to sets. In addition the dataset’s ties are directed do they flow in directions as a result of which family is marrying to which, and the ties are unweighted because marriage cannot vary in numerican significance, it is simply a category that is either true or false between families.\n\n\nvertex_attr_names(florentine)\n\n\n[1] \"name\"\n\nedge_attr_names(florentine)\n\n\ncharacter(0)\n\n\n\nnetwork::list.vertex.attributes(statted_florentine)\n\n\n[1] \"na\"           \"vertex.names\"\n\nnetwork::list.edge.attributes(statted_florentine)\n\n\n[1] \"na\"\n\nThe vector attribute names are the names of the florentine families.\nThe edge attributes do not have name.\nDyad and Triad Census\nDyads\n\n\nigraph::dyad.census(florentine)\n\n\n$mut\n[1] 20\n\n$asym\n[1] 0\n\n$null\n[1] 100\n\n\n\nsna::dyad.census(statted_florentine)\n\n\n     Mut Asym Null\n[1,]  20    0  100\n\nThe dyad census indicates that amongest that among the dyad ties, being between 2 families, 20 are mutual and none are asymptotic.
