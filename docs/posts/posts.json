    "contents": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChosen Network:\nThe Network I chose was the Florentine family dataset network from the network package. This dataset represents marriages between influential families in Florence. Each node represents a family with arrows indicating which family married into which other family.\nNetwork Size:\nNetwork size for the Florentine Family network dataset is described briefly by the code below:\n\n\nset.seed(2)\n# I access the florentine families dataset through the package \"network\"\n\ndata(flo, package=\"network\")\n\n# In order to make the dataset usable I make it into a matrix using as.matrix()\n\nmatrix_florentine <- as.matrix(flo) \n\n# Next I used the graph.adjacency command to make the florentine dataset into\n# An Adjacency Matrix \n\nflorentine<- graph.adjacency(flo, mode=\"directed\", weighted=NULL)\n\nplot(florentine, vertex.color=\"skyblue1\", vertex.label.color=\"navy\", \n     vertex.label.dist=1, vertex.size=7,  edge.arrow.size=0.5, margin=0000)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvcount(florentine)\n\n\n[1] 16\n\necount(florentine)\n\n\n[1] 40\n\n\n\nstatted_florentine<-as.network(matrix_florentine)\nprint(statted_florentine)\n\n\n Network attributes:\n  vertices = 16 \n  directed = TRUE \n  hyper = FALSE \n  loops = FALSE \n  multiple = FALSE \n  bipartite = FALSE \n  total edges= 40 \n    missing edges= 0 \n    non-missing edges= 40 \n\n Vertex attribute names: \n    vertex.names \n\nNo edge attributes\n\nThe number of vertices in the dataset is 16, in this case these nodes each represent a florentine family. Te number of edges is 40. In this instance ties or edges, represent marriages between these influential families. The is the same in both the statnet and igraph outputs.\nNetwork Features\nNext the features of the dataset are described using the 3 commands in the code chunk below.\n\n\nis_bipartite(florentine)\n\n\n[1] FALSE\n\nis_directed(florentine)\n\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nis_weighted(florentine)\n\n\n[1] FALSE\n\nThese results suggests that the florentine family dataset is not bipartite, which would indicate that they do not fall into to sets. In addition the datasetâ€™s ties are directed do they flow in directions as a result of which family is marrying to which, and the ties are unweighted because marriage cannot vary in numerican significance, it is simply a category that is either true or false between families.\n\n\nvertex_attr_names(florentine)\n\n\n[1] \"name\"\n\nedge_attr_names(florentine)\n\n\ncharacter(0)\n\n\n\nnetwork::list.vertex.attributes(statted_florentine)\n\n\n[1] \"na\"           \"vertex.names\"\n\nnetwork::list.edge.attributes(statted_florentine)\n\n\n[1] \"na\"\n\nThe vector attribute names are the names of the florentine families.\nThe edge attributes do not have name.\nDyad and Triad Census\nDyads\n\n\nigraph::dyad.census(florentine)\n\n\n$mut\n[1] 20\n\n$asym\n[1] 0\n\n$null\n[1] 100\n\n\n\nsna::dyad.census(statted_florentine)\n\n\n     Mut Asym Null\n[1,]  20    0  100\n\nThe dyad census indicates that amongest that among the dyad ties, being between 2 families, 20 are mutual and none are asymptotic. In addition 100 of the dyad are null, or not connected.\nTriads\n\n\nigraph::triad_census(florentine)\n\n\n [1] 324   0 195   0   0   0   0   0   0   0  38   0   0   0   0   3\n\n?triad_census(florentine)\n\n\n\n\n\nsna::triad.census(statted_florentine, mode=\"graph\")\n\n\n       0   1  2 3\n[1,] 324 195 38 3\n\n\n\nsum(sna::triad.census(statted_florentine, mode=\"graph\"))\n\n\n[1] 560\n\nFor dyads there are 16 possibilities. Here our results are as follows:\n324, 003 (A,B,C, the empty graph.)\n195, 102 (A<->B, C, the graph with a mutual connection between two vertices.)\nboth of which are vacuously transitive\n38, 030C (A<-B<-C, A->C.)\n3, 300 (A<->B<->C, A<->C, the complete graph.)\nwhich are both transitive\nBoth statnet and igraph confirm this, however igraph specifies the exact instances of each type of connection.\nNetwork Transitivity\n\n\ntransitivity(florentine, type=\"global\")\n\n\n[1] 0.1914894\n\nThe global transitivity of the graph is 0.1914894 which is the ratio of triangles to connected triangles.\n\n\ntransitivity(florentine, type=\"average\")\n\n\n[1] 0.2181818\n\nThe average transitivity is the average transitivity of local triad clusters. Here it is 0.2181818. This is the ratio of local triangles to all connected triangles.\n\n\ngtrans(statted_florentine)\n\n\n[1] 0.1914894\n\nStatnet code confirms this transitivity assessment.\n\n\nV(florentine)[c(\"Peruzzi\",\"Lamberteschi\", \"Ginori\")]\n\n\n+ 3/16 vertices, named, from e7ac6d4:\n[1] Peruzzi      Lamberteschi Ginori      \n\nNetwork Distances\nFirst we see that the average path length between 2 nodes in our dataset is 2.485714\n\n\naverage.path.length(florentine,directed=F)\n\n\n[1] 2.485714\n\nI then test the distances between 3 families, those being the Peruzzi, Lamberteschi, and Ginori\n\n\ndistances(florentine,\"Peruzzi\", \"Lamberteschi\")\n\n\n        Lamberteschi\nPeruzzi            3\n\nThe distance between the nodes of Peruzzi and Lamberteschi is 3\n\n\ndistances(florentine,\"Peruzzi\", \"Ginori\")\n\n\n        Ginori\nPeruzzi      4\n\nThe distance between the nodes of Peruzzi and Ginori is 4\n\n\ndistances(florentine,\"Lamberteschi\",\"Ginori\")\n\n\n             Ginori\nLamberteschi      3\n\nThe distance between the nodes of Lamberteschi and Ginori is 3.\n\n\nisolates(statted_florentine)\n\n\n[1] 12\n\nThe names of all families in our dataset is as follows:\n\n\nas.vector(statted_florentine%v%'vertex.names')\n\n\n [1] \"Acciaiuoli\"   \"Albizzi\"      \"Barbadori\"    \"Bischeri\"    \n [5] \"Castellani\"   \"Ginori\"       \"Guadagni\"     \"Lamberteschi\"\n [9] \"Medici\"       \"Pazzi\"        \"Peruzzi\"      \"Pucci\"       \n[13] \"Ridolfi\"      \"Salviati\"     \"Strozzi\"      \"Tornabuoni\"  \n\nThe names of the isolated influential families is as follows below:\n\n\nas.vector(statted_florentine%v%'vertex.names')[c(isolates(statted_florentine))]\n\n\n[1] \"Pucci\"\n\n\n\n\n",
