Each vertex or node is a family in florence. Each edge, or tie represents a marriage between the two.\nAs a result the ties are not weighted, so they are binary. However, though the dataset labels the ties are directed, they are actually all mutual so in essence, the dataset does not measure marriaage “into” a family but simply uses a mutual directed tie for every set of families with a marriage between them.\n\n\nsna::dyad.census(statted_florentine)\n\n\n     Mut Asym Null\n[1,]  20    0  100\n\nAs can be seen from the code above the dyads within the dataset are either mutual or null, meaning that between any two nodes there are no asymmetric dyads despite the fact that the network is labeled as being directed.\n\n\nsna::triad.census(statted_florentine)\n\n\n     003 012 102 021D 021U 021C 111D 111U 030T 030C 201 120D 120U\n[1,] 324   0 195    0    0    0    0    0    0    0  38    0    0\n     120C 210 300\n[1,]    0   0   3\n\nAs can be seen from the triad census above the types of triads in the dataset are 324 of the 003-type, 102 of the 102-type, 38 of the 201-type and 3 of the 300-type. The 324 of 003-type and 195 of the 102-type indicate that 519 of the 560 triads are vacuously transitive, the remaining 38 of the 201-type are intransitive and only the 3 300-types are transitive\nTransitivity\nAs can be seen in the code below indicates the the transitivity of the network as a whole is 0.1914894, which follows from the results above.

For example, explaining which node(s) are most central and which are least central. Discuss (with any related evidence) whether or not the node(s) behavior is in line with or violates expectations based on the degree centrality measure. What do you make of network density and centralization measures? What about differences in the binary 100 million threshold network vs valued trade flows network. Check tutorial for other ideas of results to discuss.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChosen Network:\nThe Network I chose was the Florentine family dataset network from the network package. This dataset represents marriages between influential families in Florence. Each node represents a family with arrows indicating which family married into which other family.\nNetwork Size:\nNetwork size for the Florentine Family network dataset is described briefly by the code below:\n\n\nset.seed(2)\n# I access the florentine families dataset through the package \"network\"\n\ndata(flo, package=\"network\")\n\n# In order to make the dataset usable I make it into a matrix using as.matrix()\n\nmatrix_florentine <- as.matrix(flo) \n\n# Next I used the graph.adjacency command to make the florentine dataset into\n# An Adjacency Matrix \n\nflorentine<- graph.adjacency(flo, mode=\"directed\", weighted=NULL)\n\nplot(florentine, vertex.color=\"skyblue1\", vertex.label.color=\"navy\", \n     vertex.label.dist=1, vertex.size=7,  edge.arrow.size=0.5, margin=0000)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvcount(florentine)\n\n\n[1] 16\n\necount(florentine)\n\n\n[1] 40\n\n\n\nstatted_florentine<-as.network(matrix_florentine)\nprint(statted_florentine)\n\n\n Network attributes:\n  vertices = 16 \n  directed = TRUE \n  hyper = FALSE \n  loops = FALSE \n  multiple = FALSE \n  bipartite = FALSE \n  total edges= 40 \n    missing edges= 0 \n    non-missing edges= 40 \n\n Vertex attribute names: \n    vertex.names \n\nNo edge attributes\n\nThe number of vertices in the dataset is 16, in this case these nodes each represent a florentine family. Te number of edges is 40. In this instance ties or edges, represent marriages between these influential families. The is the same in both the statnet and igraph outputs.\nNetwork Features\nNext the features of the dataset are described using the 3 commands in the code chunk below.\n\n\nis_bipartite(florentine)\n\n\n[1] FALSE\n\nis_directed(florentine)\n\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nis_weighted(florentine)\n\n\n[1] FALSE\n\nThese results suggests that the florentine family dataset is not bipartite, which would indicate that they do not fall into to sets. In addition the dataset’s ties are directed do they flow in directions as a result of which family is marrying to which, and the ties are unweighted because marriage cannot vary in numerican significance, it is simply a category that is either true or false between families.\n\n\nvertex_attr_names(florentine)\n\n\n[1] \"name\"\n\nedge_attr_names(florentine)\n\n\ncharacter(0)\n\n\n\nnetwork::list.vertex.attributes(statted_florentine)\n\n\n[1] \"na\"           \"vertex.names\"\n\nnetwork::list.edge.attributes(statted_florentine)\n\n\n[1] \"na\"\n\nThe vector attribute names are the names of the florentine families.\nThe edge attributes do not have name.\nDyad and Triad Census\nDyads\n\n\nigraph::dyad.census(florentine)\n\n\n$mut\n[1] 20\n\n$asym\n[1] 0\n\n$null\n[1] 100\n\n\n\nsna::dyad.census(statted_florentine)\n\n\n     Mut Asym Null\n[1,]  20    0  100\n\nThe dyad census indicates that amongest that among the dyad ties, being between 2 families, 20 are mutual and none are asymptotic. In addition 100 of the dyad are null, or not connected.\nTriads\n\n\nigraph::triad_census(florentine)\n\n\n [1] 324   0 195   0   0   0   0   0   0   0  38   0   0   0   0   3\n\n?triad_census(florentine)\n\n\n\n\n\nsna::triad.census(statted_florentine, mode=\"graph\")\n\n\n       0   1  2 3\n[1,] 324 195 38 3\n\n\n\nsum(sna::triad.census(statted_florentine, mode=\"graph\"))\n\n\n[1] 560\n\nFor dyads there are 16 possibilities. Here our results are as follows:\n324, 003 (A,B,C, the empty graph.)\n195, 102 (A<->B, C, the graph with a mutual connection between two vertices.)\nboth of which are vacuously transitive\n38, 030C (A<-B<-C, A->C.)\n3, 300 (A<->B<->C, A<->C, the complete graph.)\nwhich are both transitive\nBoth statnet and igraph confirm this, however igraph specifies the exact instances of each type of connection.\nNetwork Transitivity\n\n\ntransitivity(florentine, type=\"global\")\n\n\n[1] 0.1914894\n\nThe global transitivity of the graph is 0.1914894 which is the ratio of triangles to connected triangles.\n\n\ntransitivity(florentine, type=\"average\")\n\n\n[1] 0.2181818\n\nThe average transitivity is the average transitivity of local triad clusters.
